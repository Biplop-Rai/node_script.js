## Considerations
Platform Support
MongoDB 8.0 Community Edition supports the following 64-bit Ubuntu LTS (long-term support) releases on x86_64 architecture:

24.04 LTS ("Noble")

22.04 LTS ("Jammy")

20.04 LTS ("Focal")

MongoDB only supports the 64-bit versions of these platforms. To determine which Ubuntu release your host is running, run the following command on the host's terminal:

-cat /etc/lsb-release

1. Import the public key.
    From a terminal, install gnupg and curl if they are not already available:
    - sudo apt-get install gnupg curl

    To import the MongoDB public GPG key, run the following command:
    - curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-8.0.asc | \
      sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-8.0.gpg \
      --dearmor

2. Create the list file.
    - Create the list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list for your version of Ubuntu.

3. sudo apt-get update

4. sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
